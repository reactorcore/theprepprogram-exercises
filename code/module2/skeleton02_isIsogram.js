/*

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. 

Write and test a function that determines whether a string is an isogram. 

Notes:
* Assume your input is only letters.
* Assume the empty string is an isogram. 
* Ignore case.
* Follow the pseudocode exactly!
