/*
Use the skeleton provided to write a working implementation.

Notes: 
* Do not leave any functions in the skeleton unused.
* Test that your implementation works.

Specifically -- your code reviewer should be able to just press the [Run] button and see convincing evidence that your code works, because of:
a) the categorical reasoning displayed by your tests
b) the line(s) of output in the console log saying "passed" coming from those tests
