/*
Problem statement

Accept an array of numbers that represent a phone number.
E.g., [6, 5, 0, 8, 3, 5, 9, 1, 7, 2]
Return as a string in this format: '(650) 835-9172'.

A poor implementation

function renderPhoneNumber(numbers){
  return '(' + numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] + ') '
    + numbers[3] + numbers[4] + numbers[5] + '-' 
    + numbers[6] + numbers[7] + numbers[8] + numbers[9];
}

What you should do instead

Read the object-oriented skeleton. 

After you understand the flow of processing that it sketches out, fill in the implementation.

Notes:
* Do not leave any methods unused.
