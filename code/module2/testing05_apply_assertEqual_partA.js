/*

Write an "assertEqual" function from scratch, from memory.

Please DO NOT simply PASTE in from before.

If you have to go back and look at your previously-implemented code once, fine, but come back here and write it from memory.

Then use your assertion function in a series of test cases to thoroughly test the code.

Use categorical reasoning to consider all the useful cases.

Debug the code under test, if necessary.
