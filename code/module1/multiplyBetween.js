/*
Write a function called "multiplyBetween".

Given 2 integers, "multiplyBetween" returns the product between the two given integers, beginning at num1, and excluding num2.

Notes:
* The product between 1 and 4 is 1 * 2 * 3 = 6.
* If num2 is not greater than num1, it should return 0.

var output = multiplyBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 24
