/*
Write a function called "computeAverageAge".

Given an array of objects, each with an "age" property, "computeAverageAge" returns the average age across all the objects. 

Notes:
* It should disregard objects that don't have an age property.
* If the given array is empty, or has no objects with an "age" property, it should return 0.
* If the given array has no objects with an "age" property, it should return 0.


var jess = {age: 20};
var montana = {age: 30};
var steve = {email: "steve@stevemail.com"};
var dakota = {age: 40};

var people = [jess, montana, steve, dakota];

var output = computeAverageAge(people); 
console.log(output); // --> 30
